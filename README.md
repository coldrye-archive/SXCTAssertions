# SXCTAssertions
Handy assertions for use with XCTest and Swift, most prominently the missing assertions for exception testing such as SXCTAssertThrows.

This can be used instead of for example [Quick/Nimble](http://github.com/Quick/Nimble) in case that one does not need the extra overhead induced by Nimble.

See also [vibeswift/SwiftExceptions](http://github.com/vibeswift/SwiftExceptions) (in the works) for adding exception handling support to swift.
